The New function in a sync.Pool is needed to provide a way to create new instances of the object when the pool is empty and cannot satisfy a Get request.

# Here's why it's necessary:

__On Pool Initialization:__ When you create a new sync.Pool, it starts empty. If you call pool.Get() when the pool is empty, it will return nil unless there's a New function defined. In that case, the New function will be invoked to create a new object, which will then be returned by Get.

_Object Exhaustion:_ If the pool has a fixed capacity and all the objects are currently in use (meaning the pool is empty), any subsequent calls to Get will result in invoking the New function to create new objects. Without the New function, the pool would not be able to create new objects when it's empty, leading to Get returning nil.
